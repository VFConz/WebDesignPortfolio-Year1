     to center my top section content and have tried to be as detailed as possible
     when it comes to the design. However without css there is no complex background
     styling or font design.

  <p>
    In this post my main role was on outdoor activities such as the swans,
    Go karts and tennis courts in Newcastle. This involved the organisation
    of any equipment required to be set up in the morning to ensure everything
    was ready for the public. I was also required to take any money for the
    activities and ensure all income balanced at the end of the day.
    Supervision of children was also very important especially around water-based
    activities and the Go karts.
    When not required to work on the outdoor activities I was posted at the
    Newcastle Centre where I was required to assist with the cleaning of the
    building and setting up any rooms to be used for groups etc coming in.
